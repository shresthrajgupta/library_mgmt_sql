# Library Management using SQL

## Project overview
This project is a relational database system designed to manage the day-to-day operations of a library. Built using MySQL, it allows efficient handling of books, members, borrowing records, and returns. Key features include tracking book availability, managing member registrations, and monitoring overdue returns. The system ensures data integrity through foreign key constraints and provides a scalable structure for library databases.
